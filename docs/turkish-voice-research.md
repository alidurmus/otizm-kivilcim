  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('name', voiceName);
  audioSamples.forEach(file => formData.append('files', file));
  formData.append('description', 'Turkish autism-friendly educational voice');
  formData.append('labels', JSON.stringify({
    'language': 'turkish',
    'accent': 'standard',
    'use_case': 'education',
    'target_audience': 'children_autism',
    'characteristics': ['calm', 'clear', 'patient']
  }));

  const response = await fetch('https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices/add', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'xi-api-key': process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY },
    body: formData
  });
  
  return response.json();
};
```

### 3. Voice Design (Text-to-Voice)
```typescript
const designVoice = async (description: string) => {
  const voiceRequest = {
    description: `Gentle Turkish female teacher, speaking slowly and clearly for children with autism. 
                  Calm, patient, encouraging tone. Clear pronunciation of Turkish characters: 
                  ç, ğ, ı, ö, ş, ü. Age 25-35, warm and nurturing voice.`,
    sample_text: `Merhaba sevgili öğrencim! Bugün çok güzel şeyler öğreneceğiz. 
                  Hazır mısın? Türkçe harfleri birlikte sayalım: A, B, C, Ç, D...`,
    model_id: 'eleven_multilingual_v2' // Best for Turkish
  };
  
  return await fetch('https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voice-generation', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 
      'xi-api-key': process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(voiceRequest)
  });
};
```

## 🧠 Autism-Friendly Voice Design Principles

### Therapeutic Characteristics
1. **Calm Tone** - Stability: 0.8-0.9, Style: 0.2-0.4
2. **Clear Articulation** - Similarity Boost: 0.85-0.95
3. **Consistent Pace** - Avoid rapid changes, maintain steady rhythm
4. **Warm Delivery** - Encouraging but not overstimulating
5. **Predictable Patterns** - Same voice for same content types

### Turkish Language Optimization
```typescript
const TURKISH_VOICE_SETTINGS = {
  stability: 0.85,        // High consistency for autism-friendly
  similarity_boost: 0.90, // Clear Turkish phonemes
  style: 0.3,             // Natural but calm delivery
  use_speaker_boost: true // Clear voice projection
};

const TURKISH_PHONEME_FOCUS = [
  'ç', 'ğ', 'ı', 'ö', 'ş', 'ü', // Special Turkish characters
  'soft_g', 'dotless_i', 'o_umlaut', 'u_umlaut' // Phoneme descriptions
];
```
